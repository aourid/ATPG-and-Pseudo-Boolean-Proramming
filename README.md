# ATPG-and-Pseudo-Boolean-Proramming
 We show that generating test for combinational circuits can be reduced to an equivalent unconstrained Pseudo-Boolean (PB) minimization problem. 
 The formulation of the objective function for the equivalent problem is based on the real transformation and the l2-norm. To simplify the formulation, 
 we decompose the equivalent problem into two constrained sub-problems that are easy to solve. The advantage of this decomposition is that the solution 
 to each sub problem is either unique or, if the PB function has more than one minimum, the two solutions are equivalent. The formulation for single-output 
 circuits and multi -output circuits are given. In each case, excellent results are obtained, which show the efficiency and the effectiveness of 
 the proposed equivalence.
